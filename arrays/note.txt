Linear Search
-------------
Linear search is a straightforward method of searching where you traverse through the array sequentially to find the desired element.

How It Works:
    1) Start from the first element.
    2) Compare each element with the target value.
    3) If a match is found, return the index of the element.
    4) If no match is found by the end of the array, return an indication (e.g., -1).

Advantages:
    => Can be used on both sorted and unsorted arrays.
    => Simple to implement.
Disadvantages:
    => Inefficient for large datasets as it requires O(n) time in the worst case.

Time Complexity:
    => Best Case: O(1) (if the element is at the first position).
    => Worst Case: O(n) (if the element is at the last position or not present).
