1) find the first non-repeating/  first unique element.
2) find the second largest in an array.
3) find the third largest in an array.
4) remove duplicates from an array.
5) rotate an array k-times.
6) find max and min numbers in an array. (O(n) - TC).
7) find first and last occurence of an element in an array.
8) occurence of a given element (return the count).
9) search an element in a Matrix
    eg : const matrix = [
                [3, 5, 1],
                [8, 2, 7],
                [6, 4, 9],
            ];
        const target = 7;
10) count the majority element (element that appears more that n/2 times, (n - length of array))
