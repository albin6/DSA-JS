A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains two parts:
   1) Data: The value or the data the node holds.
   2) Next: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

The first node in the linked list is know as the head and the last is know as the tail is gonna have a reference to null

Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in contiguous/sequential memory locations instead they are linked together using a pointer, making them dynamic and efficient for insertions and deletions.

A doubly linked list (DLL) is a special type of linked list in which each node contains a pointer to the previous node as well as the next node of the linked list.

   1) data: to contain respective node value
   2) next: to link the next node with the default value as null.
   3) prev: to link the previous node with the default value as null.
