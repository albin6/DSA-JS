Stack
-----
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, 
meaning the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. 

Core Operations:
----------------
=> Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
=> Pop: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
=> Peek/Top: View the top element without removing it.
=> isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

Applications:
-------------
=> Function call management (call stack).
=> Undo/Redo functionality.
=> Balancing parentheses.
=> Depth-First Search (DFS).


A MinStack is a specialized stack data structure that, in addition to standard stack operations (push, pop, peek), 
allows for retrieving the minimum element in constant time (O(1)). It is often used in scenarios where you need to 
track the smallest element in a stack efficiently.

Key Features:
-------------
=> Push - Add an element to the stack.
=> Pop - Remove the top element from the stack.
=> Peek - Retrieve the top element without removing it.
=> GetMin - Retrieve the minimum element in the stack in O(1) time.
