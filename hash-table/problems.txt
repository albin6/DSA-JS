Basic Hash Table Operations:
----------------------------
1) Create a hash table (using an object) that stores the names of students as keys and their grades as values. Write functions to:

=> Add a new student and their grade.
=> Retrieve the grade of a student.
=> Delete a student from the hash table.
=> Check if a student exists in the hash table.

2) Check for Duplicates in an Array:

=> Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns true if there are any duplicates,
   and false otherwise, using a hash table to track seen numbers.

3) Count Character Frequencies:

=> Write a function that takes a string and returns an object where the keys are characters, 
   and the values are the frequency of those characters in the string.

4) Two Sum Problem:

=> Given an array of integers and a target sum, write a function that returns the indices of 
   the two numbers that add up to the target. Use a hash table to optimize the solution.

5) Find the First Non-Repeating Character:

=> Write a function that takes a string and returns the first non-repeating character. 
   Use a hash table to count occurrences of each character.

6) Intersection of Two Arrays:

=> Write a function that takes two arrays and returns an array of their intersection.  
   You should use a hash table to store the elements of one array and find the common elements efficiently.
